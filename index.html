            <p>
                Bruce was due to meet with former James Bond star George Lazenby and producer Raymond Chow to discuss working on a new film together.
                Bruce had been suffering with headaches and was given various pain-killers.
                Bruce went to rest, but did not turn up to the meeting as planned. Concerned, they found Bruce but were unable to wake him.
                Bruce was unable to be revived and was later pronounced dead before arriving in hospital.
                It is believed that Bruce may have suffered an allergic reaction.
